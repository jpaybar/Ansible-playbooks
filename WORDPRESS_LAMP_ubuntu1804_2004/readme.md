This playbook will install a WordPress website on top of a LAMP environment (**L**inux, **A**pache, **M**ySQL and **P**HP) on an Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 machine. A virtualhost will be created with the options specified in the `vars/default.yml` variable file. You can find an Apache virtualhost template (jinja2 file) in the files/apache.conf.j2 and a wp-config.php.j2 file that contains your website’s base configuration details, such as database connection information.

You can manually create a `wp-config.php` file by locating the sample file named `wp-config-sample.php` (located in the root install-directory).

## Settings

- `php_modules`:  An array containing PHP extensions that should be installed to support your WordPress setup. You don't need to change this variable, but you might want to include new extensions to the list if your specific setup requires it.
- `mysql_root_password`: The desired password for the **root** MySQL account.
- `mysql_db`: The name of the MySQL database that should be created for WordPress.
- `mysql_user`: The name of the MySQL user that should be created for WordPress.
- `mysql_password`: The password for the new MySQL user.
- `http_host`: Your domain name.
- `http_conf`: The name of the configuration file that will be created within Apache.
- `http_port`: HTTP port for this virtual host, where `80` is the default.
